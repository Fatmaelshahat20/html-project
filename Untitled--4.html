In computer engineering, computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, 
and implementation of computer systems.

Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular 
implementation.[1] In other definitions computer architecture involves instruction set architecture design, microarchitecture design, 
logic design, and implementation.[2]
